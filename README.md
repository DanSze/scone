# scone
**scone** (**S**imple **Con**sole **E**ngine) is a small library to make it easier for developers to make CLI applications efficiently (intentionally/originally for console games), cross-platform.

*(Please note that it is not fully cross-platform yet, currently only working properly on Windows).*

### Features:
* Efficient writing to the console/terminal
* Keyboard input (currently only Windows)

For anyone on a Windows machine, you can test a few examples that gives the basic idea of what scone can do here: https://github.com/vladdeSV/scone/tree/master/examples
